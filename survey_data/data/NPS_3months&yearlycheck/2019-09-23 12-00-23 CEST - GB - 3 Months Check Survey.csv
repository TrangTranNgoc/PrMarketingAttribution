Admittedly I haven't tried to use the system that way for months so it may have changed.","not that comes to mind. the system works, I take payments and you pass the money onto me. The time delay before receiving funds is acceptable and understandable (clearing from banks and card providers). Having to leave funds in the account to cover refunds on days where there have been few sales is annoying, but again understandable to cover yourself from losses if people go out of business. As in the case of the Cash Advance loans, perhaps once a customer has built up a history with you, you permit refunds over the retained funds value. For example I leave £400 in the account, enough to cover most goods yet some of my goods are valued at over £1000. If a customer wanted a refund for those, not only would I cry, but the customer would have to wait until I'd built up £1000 of credit in the account - which isn't good customer service - or I'd have to pay them through bank transfer and make a loss on the card fees from the initial sale. The instructions for handling refunds weren't very clear, so on my first refund (I may have had only 1 or 2), I had no money in the account so had to refund them in card rather than back onto the card. You have offered me a Cash Advance, so you must trust me to repay, so couldn't that same trust enable me to refund a transaction for an amount greater than the funds you retain?"

As a very small and seasonal business, this would be helpful in quiet months as I am charged bank charges per deposit/transaction, so for example in the winter I may take a transaction for £5 and that happens to be the only card payment that day, so the bank charges can be very high relative to takings at some times in the year. Haha maybe that setting is actually available already, I never actually go into my izettle account!!
Being able to do a partial refund after a customer has gone away would be good too but is maybe impossible, every once in a while mistakes do happen and it would be nice to be able to fix it!"

This needs simplifying. 
I'm a taxi driver and would love for the white card reader that offers  a tip option and is a lot quicker than the black card reader to be able to be mounted in the back. 
Next day or instant payment would make izettle the perfect solution. 
It's pretty good though as it is, so thanks for that.

There are a couple of features I would like to see added to the e-commerce section","An Add on for bespoke services whereby customer can choose from a range of custom designs for products they are purchasing. At the moment I can only offer 2 variants on the drop down boxes and then the client has to email me with a 3rd.
The variants are Scent (of which I have 31 different scents), glitter (there are 4 of) and Finish (2 options for this) this means it goes way over 99 and it’s not making the customers life easy when making a purchase decision.
Each of the customisable elements have an increase in price but as I can’t add them all into the drop down menu, I can’t charge extra for everything.

Also on the e-commerce page, it would be better if you could add text anywhere rather than in blocks.

I hope this makes sense?"

The client contacted me to say that the card reader payment had shown up on their bank statement.  I later found that this is temporary situation where the bank holds the money in reserve and it is later cleared.  I've noticed that when there is a failed transaction the payment is sitting in the basket.  I think I may have resolved the issue because from now on I make sure that I use the transaction in the basket rather than putting the transaction through again, to avoid charging twice.

But the card reader crashes every single time on the first sale/connection of the day.

Customer goes to pay, and it always says transaction failed on every single first transaction of the day. 

The only way to fix issues is to close app. Turn off reader, turn back in again, and then reboot app, delete from cart and then add again. 

Quite embarrassing to be fair. 

Any advice. 

Apart from that I’m generally satisfied.

Michael","Do the app to automatically open on the payment screen NOT reports! 

As not very professional if customer happens to over see. And would make transactions smoother and faster rather than having to go to menu, each and every time."
